# Install & Auto-Updates

Navigation: [Documentation index](./README.md) · [Node.js version](./node-version.md) · [Docker](./docker.md) · [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md)

Every `npm start` does three things: check the official `main` branch for a newer version, build, then launch the bot. You never have to update by hand.

- `npm run dev` (or any launch with `-dev`) **skips auto-update**, so local development is never overwritten.
- **Docker never self-updates.** It only logs when a newer version exists — update by pulling or rebuilding the image.

## Install

Requires [Node.js 24.15.0](./node-version.md). Windows users can use the [automated installer](../README.md#quick-start) instead.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QuestPilot/Microsoft-Rewards-Bot.git
cd Microsoft-Rewards-Bot
npm install
npm start
```

Manual installs and auto-updates both follow `main` — the supported public channel.

## Your files are safe

Updates never touch what's yours:

- `src/config.json` and `src/accounts.json` (or `accounts.enc.json`)
- `plugins/plugins.jsonc` and your custom plugin folders
- `sessions/`, `logs/`, `diagnostics/`, `Page/`, `.updates/`, `.git/`

After an update, new keys from `config.example.json` and `accounts.example.json` are added to your files without replacing your values.

On every `npm start`, the launcher also self-heals missing files: a missing `src/config.json` is created from the example, and `src/accounts.json` is created from the example only if no plain *or* encrypted accounts file exists. Existing user files are never overwritten.

## Commands

```bash
npm start               # update check + build + launch
npm run update:check    # check only, apply nothing
npm run update:repair   # re-apply the current version if files look damaged
npm run update:doctor   # diagnose update problems
```

Repair mode preserves the same user files as a normal update and refuses to downgrade.

## App window or terminal

`npm start` opens the Rewards Desk app window by default — the right mode for everyday use (see [Rewards Desk](./rewards-desk.md)). To force the classic terminal for one launch:

```bash
npm start -- --terminal
```

Docker, CI, and forced-headless launches always keep terminal mode automatically, since they cannot open a desktop window.

## Under the hood

<details>
<summary><strong>How an update is applied</strong> (for the curious)</summary>

<br>

The updater has two apply strategies:

- **Git installs**: resolve `main` to a full commit SHA, fetch `main`, verify the fetched commit still matches that SHA, reset the working tree, restore user files, and verify the local version.
- **ZIP/archive installs**: resolve `main` to a full commit SHA, download the GitHub tarball for that SHA, mirror managed project paths from the archive, preserve user files, and verify the local version.

The default strategy is `auto`: Git when `.git` exists, `git` is installed, and `origin` matches the configured update repository; otherwise archive.

The full flow:

1. resolve the configured `main` branch through the GitHub API;
2. require a full 40-character commit SHA;
3. read `package.json` at that exact SHA;
4. acquire `.updates/update.lock` before mutating files;
5. apply the same commit with Git or its exact commit archive;
6. remove obsolete files from managed project paths;
7. preserve and migrate user files;
8. verify that the local `package.json` matches the remote version;
9. run `npm ci` or `npm install`;
10. restart the launcher once with an internal guard;
11. rebuild `dist/` from the newly installed source and start the new version.

One update operation is pinned to the single SHA resolved at its start — if the branch moves mid-update, the update fails rather than mixing commits. The updater does not report `Updated` unless the version on disk matches the remote version after the apply step.

After a successful non-Docker update, the launcher exits and restarts itself once: the restart skips a second update check, rebuilds the runtime from the new source, and opens the normal app window or terminal mode.

<summary><strong>Advanced environment variables</strong> (most people never need these)</summary>

<br>

- `MSRB_AUTO_UPDATE=0` — disable update checks and updates.
- `MSRB_NO_APP_WINDOW=1` — keep terminal mode even when `terminal.enabled` is `false`.
- `MSRB_FORCE_APP_WINDOW=1` — force the app window on a desktop machine.
- `MSRB_UPDATE_CHECK_ONLY=1` — check and log only; do not apply updates.
- `MSRB_UPDATE_FORCE=1` — re-apply the current remote version when local and remote versions are equal.
- `MSRB_UPDATE_LOCK_WAIT_MS=120000` — maximum time to wait for another updater process before continuing with the local version.
- `MSRB_UPDATE_LOCK_STALE_MS=1800000` — age after which an updater lock can be treated as stale.
- `MSRB_UPDATE_STRATEGY=auto` — choose Git when possible, otherwise archive. `git` requires Git update mode; `archive` forces archive download mode.
- `MSRB_UPDATE_REPO=QuestPilot/Microsoft-Rewards-Bot` — override the GitHub repo.
- `MSRB_UPDATE_BRANCH=main` — branch used as the auto-update source.
- `MSRB_POST_UPDATE_RESTART=1` — internal one-shot restart guard; never set it manually.
